# OpenEats Nginx Proxy Server

This proxy server is meant as a way to easily link and serve the API and web app. Based on your environment file configuration, it will automatically bind the ports for the API and web app as well.

See [the homepage](https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats) for more information about setting your own OpenEats!
